# Rain Prediction in Australia - Machine Learning Project

**Project by:** Thomas Haskell

## Description

This project involves rain prediction in Australia using multiple classification algorithms. The goal is to train and test a model while incorporating new knowledge of evaluation metrics. The following algorithms will be employed:

- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation metrics include:

- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2-Score

## Objectives

1. Develop a classification model using various algorithms.
2. Visualize data and gain familiarity with pandas and numpy libraries.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file from GitHub.
2. Run the provided Python script to download the dataset.
3. Execute the project script (`RainPrediction_Australia_Project.py`).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillUp/labs/ML-FinalAssignment/Weather_Data.csv).

## Implementation

The project script implements each algorithm, trains the models, makes predictions, and evaluates the results using the specified metrics. The final results are summarized in a tabular format.

## Results

A DataFrame was created to show the evaluation metrics for each model in a simplified format, as can be seen below:
